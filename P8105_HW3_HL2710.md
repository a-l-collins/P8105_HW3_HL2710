### Preliminary Setup

Adjusting settings such that figures and graphs will be readable:

``` r
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

### Problem 1

Loading the dataset that will be used in this problem:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The `instacart` dataset has 1384617 observations of 15 variables. The
variables include information such as which user made the order
(`user_id`), which items are in the cart (`product_id`), whether these
items are being reordered (`reordered`), the name of the product
(`product_name`), and other such information. For example, the first
item added to user 112108’s cart was Bulgarian Yogurt with a product ID
of 49302, and this is a reordered item.

#### Determining Aisle Information

First, producing a dataset with number of items ordered per aisle:

``` r
instacart_aislecounts <- instacart %>% 
  count(aisle, name = "num_items_ordered") %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_items_ordered))
```

Then, selecting the top 5 most popular aisles:

``` r
instacart_aislecounts %>% slice_head(n = 5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 2
    ##   aisle                      num_items_ordered
    ##   <chr>                                  <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables                      150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits                          150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits             78493
    ## 4 yogurt                                 55240
    ## 5 packaged cheese                        41699

There are 134 aisles within the `instacart` dataset, and the top 5
aisles that the most items are ordered from are fresh vegetables, fresh
fruits, packaged vegetables and fruits, yogurt, and packaged cheese.

#### Number of Ordered Items per Aisle

Creating a plot that shows the number of items ordered per aisle,
limited to only aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered:

``` r
instacart_aislecounts %>% 
  filter(num_items_ordered > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, desc(num_items_ordered))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = num_items_ordered)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "chartreuse3", width = .4) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of Items Ordered")
```
